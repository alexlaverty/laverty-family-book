# Introduction


# Laverty Farm in Taylors Arm

My grandparents Leonard James Laverty and Elsie Pearl McGree lived on a farm in Taylors Arm and had 11 children, 6 boys and 5 girls.

The farm was a dairy farm and dad would have to get up early to milk the cows.

This is what the house on the farm looks like today

They sold the farm around INSERT_YEAR and these days it has been subdivided into 3 seperate plots.

This is an aerial photo of the farm from google maps

# The Pub with No Beer

The Laverty farm is down the road from the famous "Pub With No Beer",

<img src="photos/taylors-arm-pub-with-no-beer.jpg">

The history of The Pub With No Beer dates back to 1943, when farmer Dan Sheahan went to the Day Dawn Hotel in Ingham, north of Queensland, only to find American soldiers had drunk the pub dry of beer.

With a glass of wine in hand instead, he penned the poem "A Pub Without Beer".

Country singer Gordon Parsons adapted the song to "A Pub With No Beer", basing it on his own local at Taylors Arm, then called the Cosmopolitan Hotel.

When his friend Slim Dusty recorded the song in 1957, it became an Australian chart-topper.

## Laverty Family Reunion 1989

<img src="photos/reunion-lavertys-came-in-their-hundreds.jpg">

### Laverty's came in their hundreds

Hundreds of descendants of the Laverty

family flocked back to the Nambucca Valley recently for a family reunion. It was one of the many events held in the Nambucca Valley during the October long

weekend.

The family, which has traced its roots back to landing in Australia from Ireland and England in about 1860, filled the Macksville Showground hall to overflow ing for the occasion.

The hall was decorated with Bambo ferns and hundreds of balloons fishing. nets. Old and new photographs adorning the walls. A photograph of the first house built at

Taylors Arm- by a Laverty-took pride of place on the stage. About 1000 Lavertys (including their wives and husbands) took part in the reunion, including one family group with 200 descendants.

They danced into the small hours to the music of Phillip Laverty and Gavin Kings' "True Blue" band.

The dancing finished at lam, and some were back at 6.30am to decorate the truck for Open Air Mass on Sunday morning.

### Lavert Reunion Starts Tomorrow

<img src="photos/reunion-laverty-reunion-starts-tomorrow.jpg">

One of the district's best known families, the Lavertys, are staging a family reunion at the Macksville Showground this

weekend. Organisers of the event are expecting about 1,000 Laverty descendants to attend the two day gathering, travellingfrom all states of Australia and from New Zealand

for the family's first reunion. Mrs Dot Clarke, one of the co- ordinators of the event, said the family's ancestors, Sarah and Michael Laverty, emigrated from County Down, or Limerick, in 1864.

They settled first at Pola Creek, outside Kempsey, before taking up land at Taylors Arm where they built the original family homestead and raised six children, An open air Mass will be celebrated at Michael, Dennis, John, Sam, Sarah and

Cathrine. Descendants populated the valley in quick time, branching out to Thumb Creek, Bowraville and Macksville, with many still living in the district.

Mrs Clarke said the original homestead planned for almost 12 months, inspired by at Taylors Arm was demolished in 1930 but a second, built near Lavertys Bridge in 1901, is still occupied by John and Lily Laverty.

ground at Ilam with registration, when visitors will have the chance to view the display of memorabilia and perhaps catch up with a few "long lost relatives".

Lunch will follow at noon, with a photograph session at 2.30pm and a barbecue dinner at 6pm.

Highlight of the weekend is expected to be tomorrow night's family concert and dance starting at 7.30pm, with the music led by True Blue and Brendan Laverty and his band.

During the evening presentations will be made to the eldest, youngest and longest married members of the family, along with the most recent married and the couple with the most children.

9.30am on Sunday by Fr Noel Rowe, whose mother was a Laverty, assisted by Fr Frank Gorman. This will be followed by mixed sports and games with lunch at noon.

Mrs Clark said the reunion had been

her research into the family which began in 1986. "It should be a wonderful weekend provided the weather holds off; we are all The reunion will open at the show- really looking forward to it," she said.

### Laverty re-union

<img src="photos/reunion-laverty-reunion.jpg">

Is your name Laverty, or perhaps Lafferty or O'Laverty.

We are having a Family reunion at Macksville Showground, on Saturday 30th September and Sunday October 1st.

All you long lost cousins are invited to turn up. Dance to the local bands on Saturday night, after fun and games all day, Sunday morning there will be Open Air Mass, hopefully for about 1,000 Lavertys and their relations.

Our ancestors arrived here in the middle 1800, form Down, Downpatrick, Limerick in Ireland and first settled on the Macleay at Pola Creek, then selected land at Taylors Arm, Bowraville and later at

Macksville. Quite a few families still live on the land at Taylors Arm, and a large number at Macksville.

The Laverty name is well known on the Nambucca Valley. Our families married into the Chapman, Walton, Reibel, Cassin, Lynch, McGree, Foster, Clarke, Fuller, Rowe, McPherson, Ballard, Donnelly, Welsh, Hudson, just a few in our area.

Food and drink will be available on both days, so hopefully it will be a great week-end and in years to come, we can start a conversation, with "Remember our week-end at Macksville".

### Laverty reunion

The Laverty family whose obstinacy gave the area the separation of Upper and Lower Taylors Arm holds a reunion on Saturday and Sunday. Many of the family are still in the Macleay-Nambucca regions.

Others will travel from South Australia, Victoria and Queensland, and even from New Zealand for the reunion, to be held at the Macksville Showground.

An open air mass is planned at 9am on Sunday. The Laverty family, with a rather complicated family tree, has as its crest Fortune Favours the Brave but it is not known exactly why labourer, Michael Laverty fled Ballymyhinch, County Down, for England half way through last century.

Unusually for his time, he could read and write, and at Chiltern Moor, Cumberland, met and then married at Workington another Catholic, Sarah McCormick.

They and three children were assisted migrants when the St Hilda arrived at Port Jackson on February 4, 1865. A brother in law, Auguste Raymonde, was then living at Pola Creek.

Family records say they settled at Pola Creek, then (?) near Kinchela, but because of flooding moved to an area to become known as Laverty's Plains near Taylors Arm in 1884. A son, Dennis Laverty, born at Chiltern and five when they shipped for the colony, and his bride, Nora Goldspring, were to be the first couple married in the old Catholic Church on Wards Farm, the amorous suitor riding 80 miles (129km) to Orara near Coffs Harbour to do his courting. He selected his homestead, Oakvale, in 1883 and built his home in 1902.

Around the same time a John Laverty (Snr) selected land near the present Taylors Arm Hall. Sam Laverty, a son by a previous marriage of the immigrant Michael, had subsequently followed his father to Australia and selected across the river. When a milk factory was planned a site on Sam's farm was selected - but he refused to sell and the factory was moved to a site farther upstream to bring the separation of today's

Upper and Lower Taylor's Arm.

Adding further piquancy to the family tree,

Dennis Laverty's Nora was the daughter of an Elizabeth Donnelly (nee Robertson or Ribinson) who had married a John Goldspring - after first being married to a Michael Donnelly, producing two sons. She left her husband because of his drinking and following his death married Goldspring (an Irish builder and the son of a herring fisherman) who had travelled the world and a number of goldfields.

Family sources say the family was well off, but were forced to leave Ireland when "the i English confiscated their property, arriving in NSW via the USA.

A family book and other memorabilia will be on sale at the reunion.

# The Koch Family

## The Cooks of Stuarts Point

<img src="photos/the-cooks-of-stuarts-point.jpg">

This history begins in 1853 on May 3rd when Peter Koch (Cook) arrived in Australia on the ship "Droden" from Germany with his wife Anna Catherine (Schroder). He was 25 years old and he and Anna brought with them a baby son Franz (Frank) who was born on 20 Th September 1852 in Wallstadt, Germany. Both of Peter's parents, George and Elizabeth were deceased as was Anna's father Jaco but her mother, Catharina was still alive

The date of the Cook's arrival at Stuart's Point is not yet precisely known They would have traveled up the coast by sailing vessel or steamer either to the Macleay or to Port Macquarie and thence onto the Macleay. An application to establish a Public School at Yarr happini in 1880 bears the signature of Peter Cook as being on a committee of seven residents seeking education for their children. At that time Peter and Anna had 12 children but only the last five were young enough to attend school. In March of 1883 the school opened with 21 students enrolled. The first teacher was James Harvey who was 21 and who had no formal training as a teacher but would have spent some weeks in a large school learning the system

In 1883 the Kirkwood brothers opened a sawmill at Stuart's Point and a village soon started to grow around the mill Stuart's Point got it's own Public School in 1899 and this y t would have seen many of the descendants of Peter and Anna attending. The first teacher, Henry Peck from Wagga Wagga was not impressed with conditions at the Point.

"I have an inferior residence one and a quarter miles from school. That distance I have to trudge knee-deep in sand in all weathers I am 26 miles from store, church, doctor etc. and no steamer or coach to reach Kempsey Sometimes my family are without beef for a fortnight, and when supplied it is hardly fit for human consumption Further it is not con venient to keep a borse as there is no grass within miles of the Point. This is the home of Death Adders snakes and sandflies, also the dingo, but few people"

This gives a little insight to conditions at Stuart's Point in the 19th century. Although another sawmill opened in 1886, the work was intermittent and the families were poor, Peter is known to have been a farmer, lay Methodist Minister and a Vine Dresser. It is not known if he worked at the mill He was best known as caretaker of the North Coast Co's shed and wharf at Stuart's Point He was naturalized on 27/Aug/1878 Anna was a midwife at Stuart's Point

Peter died in 1909 and his death is recorded in an article from a local newspaper at the time which states he was a very old colo nist It continues "Peter Cook who died at his residence at Stuart's Point on Friday night last week. The deceased gentleman was well-known not only in the Maclery District, but also the Nambucca and Bellinger. He succumbed to heart failure following kidney disease and his death was rather sadden No one in the vicinity of Stuart's Point was more highly respected than "Grandfather Cook" as he was affectionately termed by both young and old. A Native of Germany the late Mr. Cook was 84 years of age, but he was in all respects except in regard to place of birth an Australian, as he had resided in NSW for nearly 60 years and was intintensely proud of his adopted land. Deceased was
