<h1>Alex Laverty Family History Book</h1>

My grandparents Leonard James Laverty and Elsie Pearl McGree lived on a farm in Taylors Arm and had 11 children, 6 boys and 5 girls.

The farm was a dairy farm and dad would have to get up early to milk the cows.

This is what the house on the farm looks like today

Dad said that when he was a kid he would walk to school without any shoes and occassionaly they'd go out and shoot parrots for dinner.

They sold the farm around INSERT_YEAR and these days it has been subdivided into 3 seperate plots.

The Laverty farm is down the road from the famous "Pub With No Beer",

The history of The Pub With No Beer dates back to 1943, when farmer Dan Sheahan went to the Day Dawn Hotel in Ingham, north of Queensland, only to find American soldiers had drunk the pub dry of beer.

With a glass of wine in hand instead, he penned the poem "A Pub Without Beer".

Country singer Gordon Parsons adapted the song to "A Pub With No Beer", basing it on his own local at Taylors Arm, then called the Cosmopolitan Hotel.

When his friend Slim Dusty recorded the song in 1957, it became an Australian chart-topper.

# Koch's

## The Cooks of Stuarts Point

<img src="photos/the-cooks-of-stuarts-point.jpg">

This history begins in 1853 on May 3rd when Peter Koch (Cook) arrived in Australia on the ship "Droden" from Germany with his wife Anna Catherine (Schroder). He was 25 years old and he and Anna brought with them a baby son Franz (Frank) who was born on 20 Th September 1852 in Wallstadt, Germany. Both of Peter's parents, George and Elizabeth were deceased as was Anna's father Jaco but her mother, Catharina was still alive

The date of the Cook's arrival at Stuart's Point is not yet precisely known They would have traveled up the coast by sailing vessel or steamer either to the Macleay or to Port Macquarie and thence onto the Macleay. An application to establish a Public School at Yarr happini in 1880 bears the signature of Peter Cook as being on a committee of seven residents seeking education for their children. At that time Peter and Anna had 12 children but only the last five were young enough to attend school. In March of 1883 the school opened with 21 students enrolled. The first teacher was James Harvey who was 21 and who had no formal training as a teacher but would have spent some weeks in a large school learning the system

In 1883 the Kirkwood brothers opened a sawmill at Stuart's Point and a village soon started to grow around the mill Stuart's Point got it's own Public School in 1899 and this y t would have seen many of the descendants of Peter and Anna attending. The first teacher, Henry Peck from Wagga Wagga was not impressed with conditions at the Point.

"I have an inferior residence one and a quarter miles from school. That distance I have to trudge knee-deep in sand in all weathers I am 26 miles from store, church, doctor etc. and no steamer or coach to reach Kempsey Sometimes my family are without beef for a fortnight, and when supplied it is hardly fit for human consumption Further it is not con venient to keep a borse as there is no grass within miles of the Point. This is the home of Death Adders snakes and sandflies, also the dingo, but few people"

This gives a little insight to conditions at Stuart's Point in the 19th century. Although another sawmill opened in 1886, the work was intermittent and the families were poor, Peter is known to have been a farmer, lay Methodist Minister and a Vine Dresser. It is not known if he worked at the mill He was best known as caretaker of the North Coast Co's shed and wharf at Stuart's Point He was naturalized on 27/Aug/1878 Anna was a midwife at Stuart's Point

Peter died in 1909 and his death is recorded in an article from a local newspaper at the time which states he was a very old colo nist It continues "Peter Cook who died at his residence at Stuart's Point on Friday night last week. The deceased gentleman was well-known not only in the Maclery District, but also the Nambucca and Bellinger. He succumbed to heart failure following kidney disease and his death was rather sadden No one in the vicinity of Stuart's Point was more highly respected than "Grandfather Cook" as he was affectionately termed by both young and old. A Native of Germany the late Mr. Cook was 84 years of age, but he was in all respects except in regard to place of birth an Australian, as he had resided in NSW for nearly 60 years and was intintensely proud of his adopted land. Deceased was
