My grandparents Leonard James Laverty and Elsie Pearl McGree lived on a farm in Taylors Arm and had 11 children, 6 boys and 5 girls.

The farm was a dairy farm and dad would have to get up early to milk the cows.

This is what the house on the farm looks like today

Dad said that when he was a kid he would walk to school without any shoes and occassionaly they'd go out and shoot parrots for dinner.

They sold the farm around INSERT_YEAR and these days it has been subdivided into 3 seperate plots.

This is an aerial photo of the farm from google maps

The Laverty farm is down the road from the famous "Pub With No Beer",

The history of The Pub With No Beer dates back to 1943, when farmer Dan Sheahan went to the Day Dawn Hotel in Ingham, north of Queensland, only to find American soldiers had drunk the pub dry of beer.

With a glass of wine in hand instead, he penned A Pub Without Beer.

Country singer Gordon Parsons adapted the song to A Pub With No Beer, basing it on his own local at Taylors Arm, then called the Cosmopolitan Hotel.

When his friend Slim Dusty recorded the song in 1957, it became an Australian chart-topper.

Around that area is also the Laverty's Bridge.

There were a few family who went off to world war II.
